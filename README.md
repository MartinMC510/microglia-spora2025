Upon opening the notebook, you will find an attempt at graphing the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) with glucose availability. 
However, we decided not to include these graphs in the submission as they did not capture the information we had hoped for.
Afterward, you will find the graphs that were generated during the analysis process. To locate the ones used in the submission, refer to the graphs folder.

The graphs generated in the notebook can be found in the graphs folder, organized into respective folders based on their type of variable (e.g., AB, pH, Mean integrity of the BBB). 
These graphs are compared with their binary values for the metabolic booster they represent. Any file containing "v3" is the image file that was used in the submission.
